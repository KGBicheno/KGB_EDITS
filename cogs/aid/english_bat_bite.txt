In Australia, flying foxes or other bats may carry lyssavirus* which is potentially fatal.
These animals must never be handled by people who are not trained to handle wildlife, even if the animal is injured.
*Also referred to as ABLV: Australian bat lyssavirus

Anyone either bitten or scratched by a bat should IMMEDIATELY:
