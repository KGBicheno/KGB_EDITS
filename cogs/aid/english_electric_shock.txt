• 
burns, particularly entry and exit burns 

•

Downed power lines 
•

What to do 
1 Check for danger to yourself, bystanders and the patient. 
2 Switch off power, if possible, before trying to help the patient. 
3 If the patient is in contact with high voltage lines, do not approach, but wait until power is disconnected by authorised electrical personnel. 
4 If power cannot be switched off quickly, remove the patient from the electrical supply without directly touching them. Use a non-conductive, dry material (eg a dry wooden broom handle). 
5 Follow DRSABCD. Call triple zero (000) for an ambulance. 
6 Hold any burnt area under cool running water for 20 minutes. 
7 Remove jewellery and clothing from burnt areas, unless stuck to the burn. 
8 Cover the burnt area with a loose and light nonstick dressing, preferably clean, dry, non-fluffy material such as plastic cling film. 
9 Seek medical aid.
