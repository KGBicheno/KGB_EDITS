What to do 
1 Follow DRSABCD. 2 Help the patient to lie down. Do not raise their legs. 3 Reassure the patient. 4 Manage severe bleeding then treat other injuries. 5 Loosen any tight clothing. 6 Keep the patient warm with a blanket or similar. Do not 
use any source of direct heat. 
7 Give the patient small amounts of cool water to drink frequently if they are conscious, do not have abdominal trauma, and are unlikely to require an operation immediately.

9 Seek medical aid or call triple zero (000) for an ambulance if the patients injuries require it.
