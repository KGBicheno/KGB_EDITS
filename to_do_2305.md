# To-Do List on 23/05/2020

## General actions

Rewrite the readme for this repository's current use-case.

## admin.py

- (6, 2) #TODO The admin module needs to be more about channel house-cleaning, it needs to control multi-media presence and protocol checking
- (7, 2) #TODO Shift all variable-setting and control functions interacting with brook.conf to here and brook.py
- (8, 2) #TODO Give brook.py a way of loading the admin module automatically
- (16, 6) #TODO Make $admin\_cog\_status a class method and have it check brook.conf for corruption at startup
- (24, 6) #TODO $clear\_bot\_messages needs to be more easily controlled by admins, especially through brook.conf but also at runtime
- (37, 6) #TODO $dump\_user\_list is of questionable value, ask why it's needed and then rebuild it for an output that makes sense for that
- (60, 6) #TODO The $promote command can stay but needs to have its contents set in brook.conf for each guild/server it's used in. If not, have a default prompting the admin to set it.
- (71, 6) #TODO $esperanto could be kept in as a template embed for admins to use as a promotional embed
- (94, 6) #TODO $rook or b.rook Should output brook's current status including ping, loaded modules, set/unset variables etc.
- (114, 6) #TODO The $poetry command can keep its nod to Rae, but it needs justification for existence
- (123, 6) #TODO The corrupt data function needs to have a practical use - like reporting if there really is corruption in any of the files

## emergency.py

- (8, 2) #TODO Build out the Emergency class, there's scope for having subclasses for the different types of disasters
- (17, 3) #TODO the $emergency\_cog\_status command should be a class method and should return the state of emergency level in the server location
- (24, 3) #TODO Fix the web server to the files are always available or find a better CDN - the redirect issue is killing $aid
- (25, 3) #TODO $aid needs the fuzzy search libraries built in as soon as possible - it's borderline useless right now
- (26, 3) #TODO You have multilingual versions of the fact sheets, geo-locate or make multilingual usage more streamline - yesterday
- (34, 4) #TODO Add a funnel layer to catch the broadest variation of synonyms to database entries.
- (44, 6) #TODO I know this is a hack, need to change for i18
- (45, 6) #TODO This just isn't picking up obvious matches
- (50, 7) #TODO Mirror the St John's files on my server and add a 'pretty' layer for thumbnails
- (56, 4) #TODO reintroduce the non-English languages in a future patch when you've figured out a more streamlined way to do this.
- (82, 4) #TODO Geolocate for the guild region's emergency service's number.
- (83, 4) #TODO Read those on fuzzy text matching

## gaming.py

- (5, 2) #TODO This Gaming module is a bit far down the list but consideration should be put into calling a limited instance of KGB_AFIRM in emergencies
- (12, 6) #TODO $gaming\_cog\_status would be the perfect place to use the games analysis packages give a situation report to emergency workers
- (19, 6) #TODO $dice needs to be brought into a class or extension with the rest of the monopoly functions, consider getting a licence and releasing it
- (37, 6) #TODO the $roll function needs to be the basis for the heavy-lifting of multivariate situational computation - fix its architecture asap, the regex needs to be perfect
- (145, 6) #TODO The $monopoly command is designed to keep an isolated human occupied and sane, tighten up the code
NEW
- (NoLine) #TODO Consider shelving current Monopoly code until there's a reason for it to be there

## music.py

- (1, 2) #TODO MUSIC MODULE The music module needs to be built from the ground up with the following goals

- (3, 2) #TODO MUSIC answer questions about music in general
- (4, 2) #TODO MUSIC access digital radio stations from as many parts of the world as possible
- (5, 2) #TODO MUSIC ingest as many digital radio signals as is possible given the hardware
- (6, 2) #TODO MUSIC find new hardware for her to access to ingest new forms of digital and analogue radio signals
- (7, 2) #TODO MUSIC pass that information back to the emergency and gaming modules to add to situational awareness

## news.py

- (12, 2) #TODO Add these fuzzy search APIs for news topics and first aid (or at least investigate)
- (18, 2) #TODO Research how to use classes to give secure control of the bot to future users
- (79, 3) #TODO Update the other cogs to show something at least this meaningful with their status functions, maybe rewire them all
- (132, 3) #TODO $qfes\_pull needs an output, badly. Urgently. I need to plug in the python libraries they built for geo-spatial recognition

## brook.py

- (22, 2) #TODO find a better way of including easter eggs

- (76, 2) #TODO role protect $extend and DM those roles on load to remind them to do it

- (182, 2) #TODO Brook has ?help, change $Commands to a tutorial embed perhaps?
- (203, 2) #TODO the $Advice command is useless, it should return warnings or config qfes/bom output commands
- (224, 2) #TODO the $party_cleanup command needs testing and buffing
- (236, 2) #TODO Make $playlist_me send a slightly more manageable chunk and make the output compatible with more bots
